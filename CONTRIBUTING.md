# Contributing

There are unlikely to be many contributers to this project, so this contributing doc won't be very thorough.

Main points:
1. Pull requests should point at ObsidianSuite-Master.
2. All pull requests should be rebased. It is your responsibility to keep your PRs up to date.
3. Since this project's merge strategy is centered around rebasing, don't branch/fork off any branch other than master.

There are branches in master for the latest API and Animator releases. To get the lastest, stable release, fork from there.
